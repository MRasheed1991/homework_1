[]added semantic elements like "Main" or "section" etc in the Html.
[]The vertical box on the right side added that in the "aside" element so the the developer can find it better.
[]When the file was given the code were looking messy and not in nice order,i have put the code in nice order so the  developer can understand better.
[]i have added some comments in html and CSS on some of the changes i have made.
[]in the CSS the code was very lenghty because same style were used for multiple element multiple time,i used the CSS combinators to apply the single style on multiple items.
